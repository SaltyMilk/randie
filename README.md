# randie

Randie might destroy your computer or produce and compile the most powerfull code ever written, by accident.

Use at your own risk.

Product in work, this is what quarantine and boredom makes me do.

How to use
----------
Note : you MUST run randie as ROOT, there's no fun otherwise. Randie will check that you respect that.

./randie [max_arg_len]
